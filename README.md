This data is a part of the paper uploaded to BioRxiv titled: titled "Fractality and Lacunarity Measures of Glioma Subcomponents are Discriminative of IDH Status: A Quantitative Radiogenomics in Gliomas", doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.28.573519

& in Neuro-Oncology titled the same.

# Contents:
1. All codes used in the paper for visualization, calculation and analysis.
2. Datasheets containing all the demographic and calculated information.

## Codes - Detailed description and usage directions.
1. Python files - FD_calculator and Lac_calculator - to be initially run as python files on a bash terminal to calculate individual or complete FD and Lac
2. Codes from 1-7 - Sequential analysis with each function of the code mentioned as the code title.
3. 2 excel sheets containing radiomic features of patients and fractal dimension and lacunarity of each subcomponent.
